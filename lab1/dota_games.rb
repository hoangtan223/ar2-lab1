# In Dota game, ten players (p1, p2, â€¦, p10) are sorted by their experiences
# in descending order. Write an algorithm to group these players into two teams
# (five members for each team) t1 and t2 such that the difference of total
# experiences of two teams is minimal. Explain if your solution is optimal.
